                          <p>Art has always been my calling, as cliche as that may sound. I grew up constantly writing little songs about my dogs loving cheese and about more serious things like pizza toppings. Is my food obsession too obvious? Later, I picked up drawing and painting, which inevitablly led to a passion for design. One thing led to another and here I am coding up custom websites and designing graphics.</p>

                          <p>When I'm not typing away on the computer, you can find me reading a good book, drinking creamer with a little bit of coffee and watching early 80s and 90s action movies. I'm also a huge fan of the outdoors, whether it's going for a nature hike or sipping on a margarita by the pool.</p>
